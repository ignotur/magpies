Magpies package documentation
===================================

**Magpies** (Magnetar polarisation, intensity and spectra) Python package to convert magnetic and thermal maps into synthetic X-ray observations.
These synthtic observations include the thermal lightcurves for arbitrary orientation of neutron star, spectra and polarisation.

The package requires surface magnetic and thermal maps. 
In the case of simple dipole configuration the surface 
thermal map can be created by using the Atmos collection
of numerical fits.
