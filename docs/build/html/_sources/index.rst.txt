Magpies package documentation
===================================

**Magpies** (Magnetar polarisation, intensity and spectra) Python package to convert magnetic and thermal maps into synthetic X-ray observations.
These synthtic observations include the thermal lightcurves for arbitrary orientation of neutron star, spectra and polarisation.

The package requires surface magnetic and thermal maps. 
In the case of simple dipole configuration the surface 
thermal map can be created by using the Atmos collection
of numerical fits.

-----------------------------------
Code is under development
-----------------------------------

At the moment code can create thermal X-ray lightcurves, spectra and phase-resolved
spectroscopy. The functionality of the code is developped at the moment.

If you found a bug or want to participate in code development you can open issue 
in the github or contact Dr. Andrei Igoshev ignotur[at]gmail.com
